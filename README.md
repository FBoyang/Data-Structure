# Little-Search-Engine
This is the repository for my data structure projects
Using Hashtable to implement a "little" search engine. This assignment was completed for CS 112 -- Data Structures at Rutgers University (Spring 2015).

The little search engine could complete two tasks:

Gather and index keywords that appear in a set of plain text document
Search for user-input keywords against the index and return a list of matching documents in which thes keywords occur.
